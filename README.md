# Consolidation-Integration-unit
For the final project of the semester I wanted to explore other features of websites and see what else I can accomplish. For this I dove into JAVA script, and learned how to save things locally and connect all pages of my html. This webpage is called "flickList" and is my own rendition of letterbox, I wanted to try and make a simpler version that is easier to use. By submitting a review in the Submit tab it will then take you to and save to the review tab, you can then return to these reviews at a later date and add, edit, or delete them. This project tested not only my coding skills but also my patience and critical thinking. I am happy that I persisted and completed the webpage since now I have a much greater understanding of how to connect and style css and html but also an introduction into coding with JAVA script. I was able to find tutorials online and videos on youtube to help me get my basis and understanding. Hope you enjoy!
